Notes:
* All of these terrains reuse and adapt the tilesets and artwork of the original XCOM and TFTD games terrains. It is impossible to provide in detail the use/changes made to the tilesets (.MCD/.PCK/.TAB files) but the list specifies the terrains where original/additional artwork made by the authors was included. 
* Conversion of UFO2000 original terrains to XCOM/UFO2000 required creating the necessary .RMP files for the AI to spawn and move the alien units.
* Converting UFO/TFTD terrains to UFO2000 mainly required creating the .lua map generation files.
* Combined terrains for OpenXCom was mostly done through map script rulesets, without changes done to the terrain's original files.
* Enlarged terrains are those with new map blocks (.MAP and .RMP files) designed and added to the original version.
* The XCOM and UFO2000 terrains were hosted at http://area51.xcomufo.com, which can be consulted through the Internet Wayback Machine. The original site files have been all included in the pack, in the Original Files folder.
