This includes original artwork, map, routes, tileset and globe files, even if it has been expanded and adapted by the modders. These files are being distributed here only for modding proposes related to XCom.

INSTALLATION
------------
* OpenXCom: Unzip and place the entire Terrain Pack folder in C:\Documents and Settings\User\Documents\OpenXcom\mods\

* UFO2000: Copy the .zip files found in the mod's \Original\UFO2000\ folder inside the \extensions folder of \UFO2000

* UFO: Enemy Unknown/XCOM: UFO Defense: unzip any of the files (without 2k on their name) that are inside found on the pack's \Original\Area 51 Site\ folder to the game's main folder and replace all the original files (make back-up copies first). 

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The Terrain Pack contains 70+ new terrains, as well as a new globe, to supplement those of the original UFO: Defense game while playing it through OpenXCom, UFO2000 or even the original game. It was originally created by Hobbes for UFO2000, who later updated it for use in OpenXCom, and expanded it with the contributions of other authors.

The pack includes all published terrain mods for the original game made by Hobbes, and all the terrains made for the UFO2000 opensource multiplayer clone of the original XCom game (http://ufo2000.sourceforge.net/) by Hobbes and other authors. All of those were originally published and hosted on Hobbes' old Area 51 website (http://area51.xcomufo.com/) until it went dead. It also includes Hobbes' first version of the Terrain Pack, which included all his UFO2000 terrains. 

Many of these UFO2000 terrains were later converted by Hobbes to use in OpenXCom, it was required to create new AI route nodes (.RMP files) by Hobbes for all of them in order to work with the original game, since the multiplayer versions didn't require those files. This version of the Terrain Pack is specifically designed for OpenXCom and also includes new terrains created specifically for OpenXCom by several authors and published on the OpenXCom forums.

For the individual history of all these terrains and their original authors, please read the AUTHORS and ORIGINAL FILES parts of this document, which lists the different versions of the terrains made over the years for the original game, UFO2000 and OpenXCom.

To keep all these files available, the Terrain Pack now contains a folder called \Original Files with all the .zip files of the terrains that were released and distributed by Hobbes and the UFO2000 authors, as well as the web pages where they were available. It also includes all the necessary XCom editors, tools and documentation that were used to create these terrain mods. This will allow OpenXCom and UFO2000 players to keep playing them in the future and for XCom modders to keep using them to other terrains.

Finally, there is a folder called 'Original Terrains' which contains all the original published versions of all the terrains included, as well 
"This is a gift from all the terrain modders involved to the XCom community, from all of us who were a part of the UFO2000 project and had to learn how to create XCom terrains from virtually zero other than the original game files. Play, enjoy, learn, modify and use them well in the future as we did with them." - Hobbes, January 17th, 2022.

MODDING THE PACK
----------------
There are tons of possibilities to use the pack and its contents on your mod. However, you must follow the requirements of the GNU GPL license:
* The author must have a valid copyright claim over the original software.
* You must include the original, or instructions on how to obtain copies.
* The copyright notice (this README file) must be kept in a visible location within the mod, such as the main folder, and clearly identified as such.
* The corresponding GNU GPL license (the included LICENSE file) should be kept next to it as well.
* Any changes made to the pack's original files, including removal and renaming, must be properly documented and available with the software.
* And finally, If you use the pack or any of its contents on your mod, then your mod must also have the GPL license.

Here are the most common modding uses and how fulfill these requirements:
1) You make a mod about weapons, aliens, craft, UFOs, etc. to work together with the pack but that can work separately from the pack. 
* While distributing your mod you also provide a download link to the pack, which avoids any of the GNU GPL requirements for your mod.
* You combine the pack and your mod into a software bundle, but your mod will be required to have the same GPL license and you cannot change any of the pack's contents.
2) You create a mod that requires the Terrain Pack to be modified.
* You create and distribute a patch for the Terrain Pack to work with your mod, along with a link to obtain an original copy of the Terrain Pack. The patch must document the changes being made to the pack and have the GPL license. Your mod will not require the GPL license, as long as the patch and your mod are separate download bundles. Otherwise, you need the GPL license for the entire bundle. 
3) You create a modpack that requires the Terrain Pack to be integrated (modified) to work with several other mods. 
* You include the pack in your mod as a separate folder, while keeping its README and LICENSE files inside, but you'll need to document separately any changes you make to its files and your modpack will need to have the GPL license.
4) You only use all or some of the pack's resources in a larger megamod or total conversion.
* You'll always need to keep the unchanged Terrain Pack's README file visible inside your mod's main folder, keep a record of every change you've made to its files (including removal and renaming), and give your mod the GNU GPL license. If required for clarification, you may rename the README to README_TERRAINPACK or anything similar that clearly identifies its original. 

And if you have any doubts or specific questions on how to mod the pack or the license requirements, just ask.
