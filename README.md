This means that you can download, use, modify and redistribute it as you wish, as long as you respect the conditions and terms of the license (check LICENSE files for more details). As per the license, any work that includes the Terrain Pack and its files must also be released under the same GNU GPL license. 

All the game files of the original games present on this mod are considered copyright of 2K Games/Firaxis, or the current XCOM IP holder. This includes original artwork, map, routes, tileset and globe files, even if it has been expanded and adapted by the modders. These files are being distributed here only for modding proposes related to XCom.


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The Terrain Pack contains dozens of new terrains, as well as a new globe, to supplement those of the original UFO: Defense game while playing it through OpenXCom.

The Pack includes already published terrain mods made for the original game and for the UFO2000 opensource multiplayer version of the original XCom game and that were converted to use in OpenXCom, that were originally published and hosted on my old Area 51 website until it went dead. It also includes new terrains created specifically for OpenXCom.

For a history of these terrains and their original authors, please check the AUTHORS part of this document, which lists the different versions of the terrains made over the years for the original game, UFO2000 and OpenXCom.

Finally, and since the UFO2000 open source project doesn't have a working repository anymore, the Terrain Pack also contains a specific UFO2000 folder with the .zip files of the terrains that were released and distributed for the project, and that were being hosted on my old Area 51 site as the Map Depot. This will allow UFO2000 players to keep playing them in the future and for XCom modders to keep using and adapting them to other terrains.

This is a gift from XCom map makers to the community, and specially from all of us who were involved with the UFO2000 project and had to learn how to create XCom terrains from virtually zero other than the original game files. 

Enjoy and use them well as we did.
