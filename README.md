All the game files of the original games present on this mod are considered copyright of 2K Games/Firaxis, or the current XCOM IP holder.

These files are being distributed here only for modding proposes related to XCom.

INSTALLATION
------------
OpenXCom: Unzip and place the entire Terrain Pack folder in C:\Documents and Settings\User\Documents\OpenXcom\mods\

UFO2000: Copy the .zip files found in the mod's \UFO2000 folder inside the \extensions folder of UFO2000

DESCRIPTION
-----------
The Terrain Pack contains 70+ new terrains, as well as a new globe, to supplement those of the original UFO: Defense game while playing it through OpenXCom. It was originally created by Hobbes for UFO2000, who later updated it for use in OpenXCom, and expanded it with the help of other modders.

The pack includes published terrain mods for the original game and for the UFO2000 opensource multiplayer clone of the original XCom game (http://ufo2000.sourceforge.net/), that were converted by Hobbes to use in OpenXCom. All of those were originally published and hosted on Hobbes' old Area 51 website (http://area51.xcomufo.com/) until it went dead. Since the UFO2000 terrains were originally designed for multiplayer, it was required to create new AI route nodes (.RMP files) by Hobbes for all of them in order to work with the original game.  

It also includes new terrains created specifically for OpenXCom by several authors and published on the OpenXCom forums.

For the individual history of all these terrains and their original authors, please read the AUTHORS part of this document, which lists the different versions of the terrains made over the years for the original game, UFO2000 and OpenXCom.

Since the UFO2000 open source project doesn't have a working repository anymore, the Terrain Pack also contains a specific UFO2000 folder with the .zip files of the terrains that were released and distributed for the project, and that were being hosted at Hobbes' old Area 51 site as the Map Depot. This will allow OpenXCom and UFO2000 players to keep playing them in the future and for XCom modders to keep using them to other terrains.

Finally, there is a folder called 'Modding Tools' which contains all the necessary XCom editors, tools and documentation that were used to create these terrain mods.  

"This is a gift from all the terrain modders involved to the XCom community, from all of us who were a part of the UFO2000 project and had to learn how to create XCom terrains from virtually zero other than the original game files. Play, enjoy, learn, modify and use them well in the future as we did with them." - Hobbes, January 17th, 2022.

MODDING THE PACK
----------------
There are tons of possibilities to use the pack and its contents on your mod. However, you must follow the requirements of the GNU GPL license:
* The original copyright notice (this README file) must be kept in a visible location within the mod, such as the main folder, and clearly identified as such.
* The corresponding GNU GPL license (the included LICENSE file) should be kept next to it as well.
* Any changes made to the pack's original files, including removal and renaming, must be properly documented and available.
* And finally, If you use the pack any of its contents on your mod, then your mod must also have the GPL license.

Here are the most common modding uses and how fulfill these requirements:
1) You make a mod about weapons, aliens, craft, UFOs, etc. to work together with the pack but that can work separately from the pack. 
* You can provide a download link to the pack, which avoids any of the GNU GPL requirements for your mod.
* You can distribute the pack and your mod as a bundle, while keeping the pack's README and LICENSE files inside of it, but your mod will be required to be GPL as well.
2) You create a mod that requires the Terrain Pack to be modified.
* You create and distribute a patch for the Terrain Pack to work with your mod. The patch must document the changes and have the GPL license. Your mod will not require the GPL license, as long as the patch and your mod are separate download bundles.
3) You create a modpack that requires the Terrain Pack to be integrated (modified) to work with several other mods. 
* You include the pack in your mod as a separate folder, while keeping its README and LICENSE files inside, but you'll need to document any changes you make to its files and your mod pack will need to have the GPL license.
4) You only use all or some of the pack's resources in a larger megamod or total conversion.
* You'll ALWAYS need to keep the unchanged Terrain Pack's README file visible inside your mod's main folder, keep a record of every change you've made to its files (including removal and renaming) and give your mod the GNU GPL license. If required for clarification, you may rename the README to README_TERRAINPACK or anything similar.
